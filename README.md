# Cirquemount
This is a simple, all-purpose mount for a 40mm Cirque trackpad. It can be used to create custom keyboards, macropads, gamepads, or whatever your heart desires!

It consists of one simple 3D print, and an M2.2 heat-set insert. No more, no less.

To attach the Cirque trackpad to the holder, simply use UV resin, hot glue, or any other comparable substance you personally enjoy.
